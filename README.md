Country Trivia using React, Redux and Mui from Country API! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

This is a country trivia game I made that involves 5 tests:

1. Flag Test
2. Currency Test
3. Language Test
4. Capital Test
5. Region Test

You have 60 seconds for each test and a total of 3 hints for the entire game.

After each test, you're graded based on how many you got correct and incorrect.

At the end of the game, an overall calculation is made involving your performance for each test.

This project includes React, Redux and Reduxjs/toolkit and Material UI and connects to the following API:

About Me:

I am a self-taught web developer for the past 1.5 currently building projects with every free minute I have
in an effort to one day get my foot into the tech industry and land a job as a professional web developer.

This is just one of the many projects I've created and it definitely won't be my last.

If given a chance, I'm beyond certain I won't disappoint.
